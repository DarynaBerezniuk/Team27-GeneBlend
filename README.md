# GeneBlend — genetics education website

GeneBlend is a genetics education website with two core experiences: learning DNA and gene fundamentals, and exploring trait probabilities through interactive tools.

## Features

### DNA & Gene Basics

- Interactive DNA visualisation (zoom, rotate; A/T/G/C color-coded; base pairing higlights)
- Explanations: gene definition, DNA -> RNA -> protein overview; genes to traits
- Interactive pairing demo: drag-and-drop nucleotics, see complement strands form
- Micro-simulations: mutations, transcription snippet, simple inheritance examples
- Glossary and quick quizzes for retention

### Trait Probability Calculator

- Partner phenotype selection (eye color, hair color, height range, etc.)
- Punnett squares for Mendelian traits; probability breakdown for polygenic traits with
confidence bands
- Outcome visualization: child trait cards and distribution charts
- Assumptions and limitations panel; links to deeper learning content
- Save/Share scenario (optional, privacy-first, local-only by default)
